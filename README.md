### 🚀 About the Project

C Coding is a fully responsive React.js-based learning platform designed to help beginners and intermediate learners practice, revise, and master C programming.

Originally started as a simple C programs repository, this project has now evolved into a structured web platform that categorizes 79 C programs into three difficulty levels with clean UI, animations, and smooth navigation.
